Skills
------
Comfortable in basically any modern programming language, expert knowledge of
Python and Ruby, and strong in Go, JavaScript and Rust. At companies, I
typically worked closer to the backend but could pitch in and help out with the
web, iOS or Android apps if needed.

Very effective at working with legacy code, including incremental refactoring and
fostering an environment of viewing legacy or "bad" code in a productive, non-judgmental
and understanding way.

Can lead large groups of engineers and business people to break down product
requirements into estimates with milestones.

Love computers, love software. Believe in building the right thing depending on
the problem, which can often be high quality, solid and clean software. Or
just good enough slapped-together throw-away code.

I've been programming since high school. I was contributing to open source and
worked on a team on a very popular Soundcloud-like website for musicians to
publish and get feedback on video game music arrangements.

Experience
----------
#### **Self**, 2018 - 2019
I love that tools for programmers like shells, terminals and text editors can feel
super productive, allowing chainable commands and seemingly endless customization.
When I really pay attention closely I find them cumbersome to use. I accumulated
a lot of ideas about editor UIs, and set off to make a graphical programming
interface that retains some of that Vim hacker feeling. It is a massive
undertaking, so I've been taking on some commercial work as a way to stay
connected to real-world development.

College and background
---------
#### Boston University -- Boston, MA, 2008
+ B.A. in Computer Science

Born and brought up in the USA, living mostly on the east coast. I got my first
computer when I was 4 from my uncle who was a software engineer, and have been
enamored by the thing ever since. I learned how to use MS-DOS by watching my
older cousin, and then began to follow the Internet revolution. Significant
moments include begging my uncle to drive to Staples to pick up a copy of the
Windows 95 CD-ROM on release day, meeting a precocious friend who introduced
me to Linux on the first day of 5th grade, entering high school and finding out
that the Latin teacher is a Linux nerd, and joining numerous communities via
IRC (Internet Relay Chat), the old school chat system that Slack is loosely
modeled after.
