Skills
------
Comfortable in basically any modern programming language, expert knowledge of
Python and Ruby. At companies, I typically worked closer to the backend but could
pitch in and help out with the web, iOS or Android apps if needed.

Very effective at working with legacy code, including incremental refactoring and
fostering an environment of viewing legacy or "bad" code in a productive, non-judgmental
and understanding way.

Can lead large groups of engineers and business people to break down product requirements
into estimates with milestones.

Love computers, love software. Believe in building the right thing for the job, which is
usually really high quality software. I've been doing this since high school. I was
contributing to open source and worked on a team on a very popular Soundcloud-like
website for musicians to publish and get feedback on video game music arrangements.
