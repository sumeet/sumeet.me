Skills
------
I used to say my main language was Python because it's mostly what I used before
and while working at Yelp. I use much more Ruby and Go at Remind these days, so
these days it's probably better to say those three are my mains.

At Yelp, which was a larger engineering organization by the time I left at ~300
engineers, I spent much of my time working with product and engineering to break
apart large projects, dividing and parallelizing work between engineers with
overlapping skillsets.

At Remind, a much smaller org with ~40, I've typically been the only dedicated
backend engineer on a team and have been less focused on organizing work for team
members. Team collaboration is much more about discovering the business impact of
our work, or coordinating with client devs on how the app will work, or how the API
should look.

I value fast and thorough unit tests, refactoring, small methods, small objects,
clear intention-revealing code and explicit up-front input validation.
I am very sensitive to and try my best to fix or prevent slow tests, unwieldy
and hard to understand code, bugs, application crashes and data corruption.

I'm very comfortable with my tools on a computer: I'm a 150 WPM typist and very
fast at using Vim and the UNIX shell. I've been doing TDD for several years and
am used to producing well-factored code quickly.

I wrote two testing libraries: a mocking and stubbing tool called expect
(http://github.com/sumeet/expect) and a Python clone of VCR for Ruby for testing
remote HTTP calls.


College
---------
#### Boston University -- Boston, MA; 2008
+ B.A. in Computer Science

Before College
--------------
I'm including this section to give some background on the deep connection I feel
with the computer. It's some of my experience up to the end of high school.

I became interested in computers at age 5 after learning how to navigate the DOS
command line by watching my cousin, because he would never explain what he was
doing. I learned how to launch my favorite games and taught my dad how to launch
WordPerfect.

I taught myself how to touch type when I was 8.

My first big software project was a peace-keeping Eggdrop botnet for EFNet IRC
using Tcl. That's also where I learned about UNIX, DOS attacks and remote root
vulnerabilities. If you're not familiar that world, think AOL chatrooms and
punting, but the big leagues.

I implemented auto-away for Adium because I missed the feature from virtually
every other IM client. My patch is still part of the project.

I worked on a PHP app with a team of Internet friends called VGMix. It was like
SoundCloud for video game music remixes, built on 2003 technology. Musicians
could upload their tunes and receive feedback on completed pieces or works in
progress. It included a gamified reward and badge system for musicians and
reviewers, music downloading, a chatterbox, and web forums.
